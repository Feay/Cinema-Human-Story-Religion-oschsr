Open Source Cinema Human Story Religion (oschsr)
"Thou shalt take to heart all these things said by and seen heren. Human Kind is Godkind, as God contemplated himself so creation became. AS human contemplates it's stories so shall it create new ideas of peace."
This is the biblio for the OSCHSR. It contains the scriptures and revelations of humankind. The perpose of this religion is to worship with out hearts and minds the profound thoughts that one can assertain thru the unspeakable. The written word, the showing, the telling, all have merits. But most important to us is the unseeable, the unhearable, the untellible that lies bettween the lines. It is thru our own stories that we tell, and show that are the genisis of creative ponderance. THerefore these things are good in the sight of all, the all, and the alpha.
***
To Join the OSCHSRs as a lay member is automatic, as we are all apart of our own stories. Unless you are a slave to men, tradition, dogma, sciance, in such case we urge you to go watch a film to escape and then call your local authorites, freinds, and beloveds.
***
To Join as an "Buff of the holy story of life" of the OSCHSRs your task is simple, make a list of profound moives you have yet to watch, then watch atleast two. OR watch two of these Films: Akira, The Notebook, Dune(1984), Clockwork Orange, The Gods must be Crazy,
The Princess Bride, Amélie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Breakfast Club (1985) or Léon: The Professional (1994), Lain: The serial experiments.
